** problem to solve

   Fang Mountain +3, i.e. Week 0 Day 4

          1.1
         /\
        /  \
   ----/    \

   .95       .95
   
   Each of the sub-set consists 3 subsections. In subsection, it is a
   3 minutes period. However, the power is not a constant during this
   period. Another issue is that the power meter shows the average
   power, so a conversion must be applied.

   - use interval timer to record 3 mins as a whole

     The best method is to tell the user for the next 20 second,
     what is the target power.

*** solution to this tri issue


         /
   -----/- 
   ----/ | 

    At the end of the first part power goes up:

    ( the average power from the begining of power ) * 2
    
       = ( power difference between the top and the bottom ) * 1 * 1/2 
   
    Using the area priciple, i.e. the area of triangle equals to the
    rectangle.

    So the power target at the end of that peak should be:

    target power = ( 1.1 - 0.95 ) * .95 / 4

    This will tell the user that s/he should put the target power for
    next 20 seconds. So, s/he would have 3 check points during the
    power surge.

    Therefore, the following section, i.e. the power down-ward period,
    the user should have a target number:

    target power = ( 1.1 - 0.95 ) * .95 / 3
